<h2>Out-of-band console</h2>

<p>If you cannot access your container for some reason, you can use the out-of-band console (also known as shell dropper) to invoke a root shell.</p>

<p>To use the out-of-band console, connect through SSH as follows:</p>

<ul>
	<li><strong>Hostname:</strong> <%?host></li>
	<li><strong>Port:</strong> 22</li>
	<li><strong>Username:</strong> vz</li>
	<li><strong>Password:</strong> vz</li>
</ul>

<p>After logging in with the above details, you will have to enter your VPS panel login details, after which you can select a container to invoke a root shell on.</p>
