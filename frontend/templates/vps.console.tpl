<h2>Out-of-band console</h2>

<p>If you cannot access your container for some reason, you can use the out-of-band console (also known as shell dropper) to invoke a root shell.</p>

<p>To use the out-of-band console, connect through SSH as follows:</p>

<table class="console vertical">
	<tr>
		<th>Hostname</th>
		<td><%?host></td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Port</th>
		<td>22</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Username</th>
		<td>vz</td>
	</tr>
	<tr>
		<th>Password</th>
		<td>vz</td>
	</tr>
</table>

<p>After logging in with the above details, you will have to enter your VPS panel login details, after which you can select a container to invoke a root shell on.</p>
